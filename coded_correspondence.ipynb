    "In this project, you will be working to code and decode various messages between you and your fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal Vishal. You and Vishal have been exchanging letters for quite some time now and have started to provide a puzzle in each one of your letters.  Here is his most recent letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a  Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like \"hello\" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of \"hello\", I would code my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So \"h\" becomes \"e\", \"e\" becomes, \"b\", \"l\" becomes \"i\", and \"o\" becomes \"l\". Then I have my coded message,\"ebiil\"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer coded message that you have to decode yourself!\n",
